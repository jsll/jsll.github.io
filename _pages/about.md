I am Jens Lundell, a Postdoctoral researcher working with Danica Kragic in the [Robotics, Perception and Learning Lab (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. My research interests is data-driven methods for robotic manipulation and grasping. I am currently working on in-hand manipulation of rigid objects, also known as intrinsic dexterity, deformable object manipulation, and constrained robotic grasping.

I did my Ph.D. in the [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) (Finland) with [Prof. Ville Kyrki](https://people.aalto.fi/ville.kyrki) and [Ph.D. Francesco Verdoja](https://people.aalto.fi/francesco.verdoja). My [Ph.D. thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/112725/isbn9789526406824.pdf?sequence=1) addressed the problem of probabilistic 6-degree-of-freedom multi-finger grasping of objects in clutter. My solution to those problems was to explicitly shape-complete each object in the scene using deep learning, and plan grasps on those reconstructions. I also focused on using physics simulators to gather synthetic data for training deep networks.

I hold a Master’s degree in Space Science and Technology and a Bachelor’s degree in Automation and Systems Technology, both from Aalto University.

#### My main research interests:

* Robotic Grasping 
* Robotic Manipulation
* Deep Learning
